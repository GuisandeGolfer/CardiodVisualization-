This is just a blank template from The Coding Challenge by Daniel Shiffman, that I will be using as an initial commit for different versions of my sketch. 

Additionally
===========
I added a VSCode Snippet to my User/Snippets/ directory for easily making a index.html file for future sketches and projects. 

the 'prefix' for the snippet is just "p5" which should output the snippet, along with ability to edit the 'title' of the HTML file, and the name of 
the JS file you will be running in the browser.
