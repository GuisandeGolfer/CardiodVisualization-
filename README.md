I edited the original version of Daniel Shiffman's sketch, and I added sliders to the browser

so that you can edit the stroke color's rgb values, with three different sliders for each value. 


Additionally
===========
I added a VSCode Snippet to my User/Snippets/ directory for easily making a index.html file for future sketches and projects. 

the 'prefix' for the snippet is just "p5" which should output the snippet, along with ability to edit the 'title' of the HTML file, the name of 
the JS file you will be running in the browser, and the scripts for the p5 DOM library.
